> Java creator

_James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton_ initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called _Green Team_.
Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.
_After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project_

> **Why Java named "Oak"?**
  **Why Oak?**

 Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc. In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies

>**Why Java Programming named "Java"?**
>Why had they chosen java name for Java language?

 The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.
**_Java is an island of Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office._**

Initially developed by **James Gosling at Sun Microsystems** (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996). After the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. **Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc**. Each new version adds the new features in Java.

## Benefits of Java and its features 

1. Simple and easy to learn.
2. Java is  almost fully OOP.
3. Java is robust and secure.
4. Architecture neutral and portable.
5. Multithreading
6. Provides High Performance
7. Interpreted

## How Java Compiler Works
1.  Whenever, a program is written in JAVA, the javac compiles it.
    The result of the JAVA compiler is the .class file or the bytecode and not the machine native code (unlike C compiler).
   2.  The bytecode generated is a non-executable code and needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. This interpreter is the JVM and thus the Bytecode is executed by the JVM.
   3.  And finally program runs to give the output.

## Java's Slogan 
> **Write once, run everytime.**



## Rules and Regulation for JAVA Programming

**1. Case Sensivity :-** Java is case sensitive, which means hello and Hello would have different meaning.

**2. Class Name :-** For all class names the first letter should be in Uppercase.If several words are there used to form a name of the class,each inner word's first letter should be in UpperCase.<br /> 
**Ex:- HelloWorld.java, MyfirstClass.java**

**3. Method Name:-** All methods name should start with a lowercase letter. If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's letter should be in 
Uppercase.<br />
**Ex:- public void sayHello(), public int getId()**

**4. Program File Name:-** Name of the program file should exactly match the class name which contains main method.(if the file name and the class name do not match ,your program will not run).<br />
**Ex:- Assume "Hello world" is the class name. Then the file name should be saved as HelloWorld.java**

> Tips:

**For compile --- javac HelloWorld.java**

**For Run     --- java HelloWorld**
