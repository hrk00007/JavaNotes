## HISTORY OF JAVA
> Java creator

_James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton_ initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called _Green Team_.
Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.
_After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project_

> **Why Java named "Oak"?**
  **Why Oak?**

 Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc. In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies

>**Why Java Programming named "Java"?**
>Why had they chosen java name for Java language?

 The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.
**_Java is an island of Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office._**

Initially developed by **James Gosling at Sun Microsystems** (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996). After the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. **Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc**. Each new version adds the new features in Java.
